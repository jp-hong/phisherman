# Phisherman

This is a basic web crawler to collect phishing urls from phishtank.com
It collects urls that are valid and online. This project was created to
practice Python web crawling.

If you are simply after phishtank data, it can be downloaded from their
website.

NOTE: Trying to crawl too many pages will result in a rate limit.
